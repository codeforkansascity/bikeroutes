# Bike Routes

This project will create a mechanism for cyclists to help identify safe and efficient bike routes 
and make them available in an existing or new digital tool.

Bicycling:
* reduces road congestion, air pollution, and noise pollution
* promotes exercise and reduces health care costs
* is less expensive than driving
* infrastructure raises nearby property values
* is the second most popular outdoor activity in the country
